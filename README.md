# Youtube-transcript-Summarizer
#### Project Context:
The digital landscape is flooded with an overwhelming number of video recordings daily. Watching lengthy videos can be time-consuming, and extracting relevant information becomes challenging. This project addresses this issue by automating the summarization of video transcripts. By quickly identifying key patterns in the content, users can save time and effort that would otherwise be spent on watching the entire video.

#### Objective:
A Chrome Extension that interfaces with a backend REST API. This extension will send a request to the API, where it will leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate a summarized version of a YouTube transcript.
